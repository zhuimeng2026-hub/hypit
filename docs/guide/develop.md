title: Development Guide
description: Getting started with Hypit development.
---

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Version | Required for |
|---|---|---|
| Node.js | 22.15+ | everything |
| pnpm | 10.33.x | workspace management; selected by the root `packageManager` field |
| Python | 3.10–3.13 | local WhisperX and OpenCV Managed Programs |
| uv | latest | Python environment management |
| ffmpeg / ffprobe | recent stable | media processing |
| Chrome / Chromium | downloaded by `hypit runtime up` | local HyperFrames rendering |
| git | recent stable | cloning the Hypit repository |

Node.js and pnpm are the only hard requirements. The rest are needed only for live Builds.

> **LAN-only deployment?** If the client has no public-internet access (or should not
> use it), every dependency above is served by a self-hosted mirror on the LAN. Read
> [Win10 client over an internal mirror LAN](./win10-internal-mirrors.md) before
> installing anything — that guide covers the `~/.npmrc`, `uv.toml`, ffmpeg on PATH,
> `hypit.runtime.json`, `git clone` and Skill install in one sequence.

Before the first local render, run `hypit programs up --runtime <profile> --endpoint <render-instance>`.
`hypit runtime up --runtime <profile>` also prepares the Profile's programs and starts its Worker.
This browser preparation does not depend on pnpm allowing dependency install scripts.
Use `hypit doctor --runtime <profile>` to inspect missing setup without installing it.

## Daily workflow

```bash
corepack enable
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile # after pulling or changing dependencies
pnpm check            # TypeScript type-check
pnpm test             # full test suite
```

| Command | What it runs |
|---|---|
| `pnpm check` | `tsc -p tsconfig.json --noEmit` |
| `pnpm test` | package, service-adapter and repository-boundary tests through Node's test runner |

See [Testing](./testing.md) for environment-gated tests and test patterns.
