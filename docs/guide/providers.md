title: Models and Providers
description: Choose an account, connect a service or add a model without changing the video execution system.
---

A **Model** defines what you ask to generate: its inputs, supported parameters and output type.
A **Provider** knows how to fulfill that request through a particular service. An **Endpoint** is a
configured instance of that Provider, with its service address, credential reference and capacity.
The Runtime Profile binds the requested capability to an Endpoint.

Hypit's official Distribution selects local Providers and the HypiHub Provider as defaults.
TokenDance, HiAPI, Pollo, BeatAPI and Monid Providers are independently versioned packages installed
by projects that choose those services. Other services connect through packages owned by the
production or their authors. The Agent can implement a new service through the public SDK, just as
it can create a visual component for a video.
[Model and deployment services](./service-partners.md) introduces independent partners through that
same path. Choosing a service is separate from [choosing an Agent environment](./agents.md).

HypiHub is the recommended integrated hosted service. **BYOK** means bringing an account's own
API key: the key connects to the service that issued it, through a compatible Provider. Tell the
Agent which service you already use and provide its API documentation; the Agent can handle the
connection and project package. A key authorizes requests but does not implement that API. One
project can use different services for different capabilities, with each service's own account
and charges.

## Choose the change that matches the need

| You want to… | Change |
| --- | --- |
| Use another key for the same service | The credential reference and selected Endpoint configuration |
| Use another compatible service address | The address or deployment options supported by the Provider |
| Run the model on your own cloud deployment | Prepare its inference service, then configure a compatible Provider or implement its API |
| Use the same model through a different API | Install or write a Provider for that API and select its Endpoint |
| Use a model not yet defined | Add a Model package and a Provider that supports its request |

Two services offering the same model can have different request formats, limits or available
parameters. The Provider checks the request against that service's support and explains a mismatch.
A Profile chooses the route; an error on that route does not authorize spending through another account.

For an existing installation, inspect the selected Profile and credential status first. A starter
Profile supplies configuration examples; choose the services you want before connecting accounts or
preparing their dependencies. [Runs and Builds](../quickstart/run.md) shows the commands.

## Use your own model deployment

You can run a model on compute you control and connect the resulting inference service to Hypit.
The cloud platform provides deployment and compute; the Model defines the generation request;
the Provider implements the serving API; the Endpoint selects the deployed address and credentials.

An existing Provider can connect to a deployment with the same complete protocol. A different API
can use a project package such as `packages/provider-my-cloud/`. The serving protocol determines
that implementation boundary, rather than the cloud platform's brand. If the model is not already
described by Hypit, add its Model definition as well.

Preparing a deployment can involve model files, compute configuration and a serving process.
Your Agent can use the chosen platform's and model's instructions to establish that service, its
persistence and compute costs. Platform-management access and inference access may be separate.
Once available, the deployment receives ordinary requests through its Endpoint; provisioning a
deployment and executing a video Build have separate lifetimes.

## Add a Model

Develop a project package against `@hypit/hypit/generation/model`, `@hypit/hypit/generation`,
`@hypit/hypit/author`, `@hypit/hypit/producer`, `@hypit/hypit/admission` and `@hypit/hypit/markup`.
Declare the exact request ports, parameter values, result type and capability. Its author Surface
connects prompt Text and reference media to the request, then publishes the resulting media as a
normal graph Output.

The [Generation Model authoring API](https://github.com/hypit-ai/hypit/blob/main/packages/generation/README.md#exact-model-authoring) includes a
request definition and explains activation. The package owns the model interface; credentials and
HTTP mapping belong to the Provider.

## Add a Provider

Use the selected `@hypit/hypit` release as a development dependency and import the public SDK:

```ts
import { defineEndpointPackage } from "@hypit/hypit/endpoint";
import type { AsyncEndpoint, CredentialRef, EndpointRequest } from "@hypit/hypit/endpoint";
```

Implement the exact capabilities and result types the service supports. Map request ports to the
service API, resolve the declared credentials, and return its results. An immediate operation
returns directly; a remote task can submit an ID, poll for completion and collect the output files.
Concurrency and action limits belong to the Endpoint's resource declarations.

A genuine failure ends that execution attempt. Build Results preserve completed Outputs and public
task receipts. Further work uses a new Run and Build with suitable existing Outputs selected for reuse.

The [Endpoint SDK](https://github.com/hypit-ai/hypit/blob/main/packages/endpoint/README.md)
owns the handler interfaces, activation, resource declarations and pricing API. Compile the package
to JavaScript and install it in the project through its package manager. Configure its Endpoint
under `endpoints` and select it in `bindings` in the [Runtime Profile](./runtime.md).

The [complete project Provider example](https://github.com/hypit-ai/hypit/tree/main/examples/provider-package)
demonstrates reference uploads, task receipts, collection and pricing using an illustrative API.
It also ships with the executable, so the Agent can adapt it without a repository checkout. It holds
two packages: `provider-images` for a generated image, and `provider-videos` for a generated video
whose service receives the wider reference vocabulary — images, videos, audio and first/last frames —
and returns its result through a separate collection step.

Implement the capability that matches your service's request shape; a service that renders both
images and video can declare both capabilities in one package. A service often supports a narrower
range than the Model's vocabulary allows, such as fewer resolutions or a lower maximum duration.
That difference belongs to the Provider: report it from the capability's `supports` so `plan` refuses
the request with a reason, rather than editing the shared Model or silently narrowing the author's
request.

## Model a remote video task

A service that renders video usually submits a job, polls it and then downloads the result, which
the Endpoint SDK expresses as three separate actions:

- `start` submits the request and returns `pending` with the service's task id. The HTTP bound covers
  the API call, not the render, so `start` returns as soon as the service accepts the job. Record the
  task id through `checkpoint` before returning, so an interrupted Build still names the remote work
  it began.
- `poll` returns `pending` while the job runs, `ready` when it finishes, or `failed` with the
  service's own error code. Return `wakeAfter(handle, delayMs)` to schedule the next check.
- `collect` downloads the finished media and stores it through `context.resources`, returning the
  Model's declared result value. Keeping collection separate from polling lets download capacity be
  configured independently of task capacity.

Inputs whose bytes do not exist until an upstream step runs stay ordinary graph edges. The URL
resolver passed to `compileWireRequest` is where your Provider uploads a reference and returns the
service's URL for it, so no other part of the system learns the service's upload protocol.

## Prices and permission

The Provider declares local work without a Provider charge, or supplies its published pricing page.
It can also read current rates using the Endpoint's credentials and return a concise summary with
the original pricing documents. `hypit pricing <run>` brings those rates together with the planned
requests. Pending media measurements remain unknown until the material exists.

Rates help explain the cost. The user's agreement supplies permission to spend through the selected
account for the agreed work and budget. That permission is separate from a successful login or an
available balance.
