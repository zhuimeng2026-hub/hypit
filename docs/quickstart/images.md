title: Image Operations
description: Compose, correct and cut out images before they reach a generator or a Track.
---

Three packages work on a picture and hand back a picture. None of them produces a Track: each output
is an image you reference downstream — as a Seedance reference frame, as a Media Item, or as the
source of another operation.

They all need an endpoint. `image-compose` and `image-transform` ask for the raster capability, which
`@hypit/provider-image-opencv-local` answers by running OpenCV in a bounded Python process on
your own machine; `background-removal` asks for its own capability, which a selected project Provider implements. Select the supporting Endpoint in your [Runtime Profile](../guide/runtime.md)
when using these operations.

## Composing layers

`compose:Image` paints layers onto one canvas, in the order they are written, and hands back a PNG.

```svml
<import as="compose" from="@hypit/image-compose@1"/>
```

The element takes `id` and `canvas`, and optionally `background` — which must carry alpha, as
`#RRGGBBAA`, and defaults to fully transparent. Its children are `compose:Layer`, at least one and at
most sixty-four, each empty:

| Attribute | Takes |
|---|---|
| `source` | required — an image |
| `frame` | required — a `space:Frame` |
| `fit` | optional — `contain` (default), `cover` or `stretch` |
| `interpolation` | optional — `nearest`, `linear`, `cubic`, `area` or `lanczos` (default) |
| `opacity` | optional — 0 to 1, default 1 |

```svml
<compose:Image id="card" canvas={portrait} background="#00000000">
  <compose:Layer source={background.image} frame={full} fit="cover"/>
  <compose:Layer source={product.image} frame={product-frame} fit="contain"/>
</compose:Image>
```

**Output:** `{card.image}` — an image, not a Track.

## Correcting an image

An `image:Program` is a named list of operations; an `image:Transform` runs one over a source. The
split is deliberate: a program written once is applied to every shot that needs the same treatment.

```svml
<import as="image" from="@hypit/image-transform@1"/>
```

`image:Program` takes only `id`, and holds its operations as children, applied in the order written:

| Operation | Attributes |
|---|---|
| `Crop` | `x`, `y`, `width`, `height`; optional `unit="fraction" \| "pixel"` |
| `Resize` | `width`, `height`; optional `fit`, `interpolation`, `background` |
| `Rotate` | `degrees`, which must be `90`, `180` or `270` |
| `Flip` | optional `axis="horizontal" \| "vertical" \| "both"` |
| `Denoise` | optional `luma`, `chroma`, `template-window`, `search-window`, `saturation-recovery` |
| `Color` | optional `exposure-stops`, `contrast`, `saturation`, `temperature`, `tint`, `gamma` |
| `Sharpen` | optional `amount`, `radius`, `threshold` |
| `Blur` | `sigma` |
| `Alpha` | optional `mode="preserve" \| "flatten"`; `background` is required by `flatten` and refused by `preserve` |
| `Encode` | optional `format="png" \| "jpeg" \| "webp"`, `quality`, `background` |

A program may hold at most one `Encode`, and it must be last. Every operation but `Blur`, `Rotate`
and `Crop` runs on defaults alone, so `<image:Denoise/>` is a complete instruction.

`image:Transform` takes `id`, `source` and `program`, all required.

```svml
<image:Program id="clean-gpt-image">
  <image:Denoise/>
  <image:Encode format="png"/>
</image:Program>

<image:Transform id="clean-shot" source={shot.image} program={clean-gpt-image}/>
```

**Output:** `{clean-shot.image}`. The program on its own produces no image — it is a recipe, and
naming it in a `Transform` is what runs it.

## Removing a background

```svml
<import as="remove" from="@hypit/background-removal@1"/>
```

`remove:Background` is empty and takes `id` and `source`. It picks no model, threshold or storage —
that is the endpoint's business, not the Source's.

```svml
<remove:Background id="cutout" source={portrait.image}/>
```

**Output:** `{cutout.image}` — typically fed to a Media Item so a presenter sits over the picture
rather than in a box.

## Removing a moving person's background

For a presenter over another picture, process the generated or supplied video with
[`@hypit/volcengine-matting`](https://github.com/hypit-ai/hypit/blob/main/packages/volcengine-matting/README.md),
served by a supporting HypiHub Endpoint:

```svml
<import as="matte" from="@hypit/volcengine-matting@1"/>
<matte:Portrait id="cutout" source={performance.video}/>
```

Normalize `cutout.video` to prepare it for the timeline. If it establishes the spoken program,
align that prepared media to its Script Segment and assemble it through Timeline assembly. Present the
picture with Media Track or a project scene, at the chosen location and paint order. As B-roll,
the normalized cutout can enter Media Track directly. Matting changes the picture's background;
the composition determines its role.
