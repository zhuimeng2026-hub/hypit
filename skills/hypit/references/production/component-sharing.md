# Sharing a project package

Read this when someone else needs a project component, Prompt Kit, Model, or Provider.

Creating a component and distributing it answer different questions. Create the component when the
work needs its visual role, semantic behavior or interaction. Distribution begins when its owner
wants another project or person to use the same package. Its component model and ownership stay the
same across that boundary.

## Share the package that owns the component

A component normally begins under the video project's `packages/` directory. Give it an owner-scoped name,
such as `@studio/score-strip`. Sharing it means giving the other project that package's code, assets,
and usage instructions. Neither author nor consumer needs a Hypit repository checkout.

Keep the same name when distributing it. The Source import names its logical Module ABI:

```xml
<import as="score" from="@studio/score-strip@1"/>
```

Here `@1` names the logical Module ABI used by the Source. The package manager separately records
the physical npm release, such as `1.2.0`. Updating that package release does not by itself change
the logical import. Follow the package's actual published vocabulary for its author interface.

## Publish for repeated distribution

For stable reuse across projects, publish a versioned package under its owner's npm scope or private
registry when that owner chooses distribution. For a public scoped package, the publication command is:

```bash
npm publish --access public
```

Consumers install the selected release with their usual package manager:

```bash
npm install --save-exact @studio/score-strip@1.2.0
# or
pnpm add --save-exact @studio/score-strip@1.2.0
```

The project lockfile records the installed dependency tree. Updates are explicit package-manager
operations; Builds use the selected installed code. A missing package is an installation problem.
Select the intended new release in the consumer project, inspect its changed vocabulary where
relevant, check the actual Source/Run and review the changed behavior. New Builds load that selected
implementation; restart an existing Studio session to load package-code changes. Reuse compatible
media through Run Candidates while recomputing the component being revised. The package's own
release notes describe any required author changes; no Build upgrades or migrates it automatically.

## Send a tarball to another person

For an explicit direct handoff or development check, build the package and run `npm pack` in its directory. A TypeScript package
compiles to JavaScript; a JavaScript package may already have executable files. Its `prepack` script
can perform the build. For example:

```bash
cd packages/score-strip
npm pack
```

For `@studio/score-strip` version `1.2.0`, npm creates `studio-score-strip-1.2.0.tgz`. Send that file.
This route needs no registry account or publication. The consumer can keep it under the video
project's `vendor/` directory and install it from that project:

```bash
npm install ./vendor/studio-score-strip-1.2.0.tgz
```

Keep the tarball with the project while its dependency points to that file, along with `package.json`
and the lockfile. Source imports select author contributions; Runtime Profile entries select Provider
contributions. To send the next release, give it a new package version, create a new tarball, and
install that file explicitly.

## Make a public release discoverable

People can find a public component through its npm page, source repository, or a community link.
Ordinary package metadata makes those existing discovery surfaces useful. For example, add fields
like these to the package that already owns the component:

```json
{
  "description": "A speech-timed score strip for Hypit videos.",
  "keywords": ["hypit", "hypit-author-package", "scoreboard"],
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "git+https://github.com/studio/score-strip.git"
  },
  "license": "MIT"
}
```

The description and keywords help npm search; they do not define the component ABI. The README should
show the visual role, a copyable Source import and element example, the package's public outputs, and
the selected Hypit release used to check it. Include the Surface poster and, when motion or state is
central to the idea, a short representative clip or animation. The source repository, publisher,
license and selected release give a recipient the facts needed to choose whether to install it.

After installation, inspect the package's own declarations:

```bash
hypit vocabulary @studio/score-strip
```

That output explains the installed release's Surfaces and vocabulary. npm or the selected private
registry remains the authority for package bytes and versions; the project lockfile records the
consumer's exact choice.

## Adapt the package under its owner's identity

Ordinary changes to words, media, timing, palette or exposed parameters remain in the consuming
project's Source and Recipes. When someone changes the reusable mechanics or public behavior, the
fork can take that owner's package scope and Module identity, subject to the original license. The
new package is then installed, versioned and imported through the same mechanism as any other shared
component.

## Include what the recipient needs

The package's `files` and `exports` should include its built activation, runtime code, preview assets,
and any Sources or templates exposed by its vocabulary. `hypit.activation` points to the shipped
JavaScript entry. Declare third-party runtime dependencies in `dependencies`. Include a README with
an actual Source example, the public outputs, any companion or asset requirements, and the Hypit
release used to check it. Inspect the tarball contents with `npm pack --dry-run`.

An executable Author Package develops against the narrow `@hypit/hypit/author`, `producer`, `admission`
and `markup` owners it actually needs, plus relevant domain subpaths, with `@hypit/hypit` as a development dependency. Its release contains its own code and assets;
the active Hypit Distribution supplies the framework APIs when loading it. Check the package from a
separate consumer project so local source links do not conceal omitted files or dependencies.

Package code runs as trusted JavaScript in the host process. The recipient chooses which package and
release to install.

## Data packages remain data

A Prompt Kit can export an `.svs` Source through ordinary package `exports` without activation code:

```xml
<import as="ugc" source="@studio/image-kits/phone-ugc-v1"/>
```

That reads the selected package data. The same packing, installation, versioning, and file-completeness
rules apply. [Project handoff](../creation/project-files.md#hand-over-an-editable-production) explains
sharing the Sources, Runs, assets and Results needed to continue a video on another machine.

## Official Distribution ownership is a separate decision

A package maintained in the official Hypit Distribution becomes part of Hypit's product and release
surface. A proposal for that ownership begins with an issue that explains the shared production need
and maintenance boundary. Community reuse remains under the package owner's own releases, independent
of that product decision.
