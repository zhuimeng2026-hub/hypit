# `@hypit/provider-tokendance`

Hypit Runtime Provider for a [TokenDance](https://tokendance.space) account. It submits generation
requests with a TokenDance API key through the gateway protocols TokenDance documents for each model
and stores the returned files in the current Build.

| Capability | TokenDance model | Protocol |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `@hypit/seedance@1#seedance-2` | `seedance-2.0` | Ark `POST /ark/v3/generations/tasks`, polled at `GET /ark/v3/generations/tasks/{id}` |
| `@hypit/seedance@1#seedance-2-fast` | `seedance-2.0-fast` | same |
| `@hypit/seedance@1#seedance-2-mini` | `seedance-2.0-mini` | same |
| `@hypit/seedance@1#seedance-2.5` | `seedance-2.5` | same |
| `@hypit/seedream@1#seedream-5-lite` | `seedream-5.0-lite` | Ark `POST /ark/v3/images/generations`, synchronous |
| `@hypit/minimax-h3@1#minimax-h3` | `minimax-h3` | MiniMax `POST /minimax/v2/video_generation`, polled at `GET /minimax/v2/query/video_generation/{id}` |

The TokenDance catalogue at `GET /gateway/v1/models` lists further models; this Provider maps only
the models the Distribution already describes.

Video requests write the prompt and each media input as one item of the protocol's `content`
array with its `role` (`first_frame`, `last_frame`, `reference_image`, `reference_video`,
`reference_audio`), then `resolution`, `ratio`, `duration` and, for Seedance, `generate_audio`;
`web-search="true"` adds `tools: [{ "type": "web_search" }]`. Seedance visual references require
`person-reference`; the Provider accepts the declaration and transmits nothing for it, since the Ark
protocol has no such field. Seedance 2.0 and 2.5 reject reference images and videos that contain a
real human face; TokenDance offers no way to register authorized portrait material, so such a request
fails with the service's moderation error.

Seedream requests send the Ark `size` in pixels: the authored `quality` selects the 2K, 3K or 4K
tier and `aspect-ratio` the entry from the Ark reference table for Seedream 5.0 lite. Output uses
`response_format: "url"` and `watermark: false`. `nsfw-check` has no Ark field and is not sent.

Service limits this Provider reports as unsupported before submitting:

- Seedance 2.5 frame mode (`first-frame` present) requires `aspect-ratio="adaptive"`.
- MiniMax H3 text-to-video requires an explicit `aspect-ratio`; frame and reference modes may omit it.

Reference media reach each protocol the way its documentation provides. Ark takes images under
30 MB and audio up to 15 MB inline as `data:` URLs within a 64 MB request body; the Provider checks
both before submitting. An Ark reference video takes a URL only; configure `publicAssetUrl` when
embedding the Provider, otherwise such a request fails before submission. MiniMax inputs are
uploaded through the gateway's `POST /minimax/v1/files/upload` with `purpose:
video_generation_input` (images up to 30 MB, videos up to 50 MB, audio up to 15 MB) and referenced
as `mm_file://{file_id}`; MiniMax keeps such files for seven days.

Runtime Profile example:

```json
{
  "format": "hypit.runtime-local@1",
  "dataRoot": ".hypit/runtimes/local",
  "credentials": {
    "local": {
      "use": "@hypit/credential-store-local"
    }
  },
  "endpoints": {
    "tokendance.default": {
      "use": "@hypit/provider-tokendance",
      "pool": "tokendance.default",
      "config": {
        "apiKey": { "store": "local", "key": "tokendance.api-key" },
        "defaultConcurrency": 3,
        "pollIntervalMs": 10000
      }
    }
  },
  "bindings": {}
}
```

`baseUrl` defaults to `https://tokendance.space/gateway`. Store the API key with
`hypit auth login tokendance.default --runtime hypit.runtime.json`. Optional `requestTimeoutMs`,
`operationTimeoutMs` and `actionLimits` bound single HTTP calls, the whole remote task and action
concurrency. Task and HTTP failures keep TokenDance's `error.code` and message, with any signed URL
in the message redacted.
Polling transport failures and HTTP 429/5xx preserve the same task and honor standard `Retry-After`;
the scheduled wake never passes the original operation deadline. Other errors end the local attempt.
