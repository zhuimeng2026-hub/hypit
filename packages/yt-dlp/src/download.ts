/**
 * Fetch a video that lives at a link rather than on disk.
 *
 * Most of the videos anybody wants to reconstruct are on TikTok, YouTube, Instagram or Bilibili
 * rather than in a folder. `yt-dlp` is what turns one into a file; everything after that reads the
 * file and never learns where it came from.
 *
 * The tool is a pinned Python dependency prepared explicitly by `hypit download prepare`, not a
 * binary the machine happens to carry. `yt-dlp` releases constantly because it is chasing sites that
 * keep changing, so an unpinned copy makes the same link fetch differently on two machines. This is
 * the same shape WhisperX and OpenCV already use for their Python programs.
