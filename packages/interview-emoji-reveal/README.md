# Emoji Reveal

The EmojiReveal Surface accepts one completed Timeline, an absolute outer Window and absolute reveal
Instants. A Narrative or other domain projector may publish those values upstream.

Reusable Hypit author vocabulary for a top-of-frame icon answer strip.

The strip owns one outer projected `TemporalWindow`. An Item is either preset from the first frame or
accepts one resolved `TemporalInstant`.
Display order is source order: preset Items come first, then revealed Items in strict chronological
order. The EmojiReveal receives one placeholder image and every Item receives one answer image: `n` answers
therefore have exactly `n + 1` explicit image inputs. A Moment replaces only its own slot, so earlier
answers remain and later slots remain unanswered.

```xml
<media:Image id="question-icon" src="./icons/rendered/question-mark.png"/>
<media:Image id="manifest-icon" src="./icons/rendered/sparkles.png"/>
<media:Image id="real-estate-icon" src="./icons/rendered/building-estate.png"/>
<media:Image id="bitcoin-icon" src="./icons/rendered/currency-bitcoin.png"/>

<emoji:Style id="emoji-strip" recipe={styles.emoji-strip}/>

<emoji:EmojiReveal id="rules" timeline={speech.timeline} within={vertical.bounds}
  style={emoji-strip} placeholder={question-icon} during={speech.window}>
  <emoji:Item id="manifest" icon={manifest-icon} preset="true"/>
  <emoji:Item id="real-estate" icon={real-estate-icon} at={real-estate}/>
  <emoji:Item id="bitcoin" icon={bitcoin-icon} at={bitcoin}/>
</emoji:EmojiReveal>
```

`Selection`, `Segment` and a `boundary` fallback are deliberately not part of an Item's vocabulary.
The component consumes the shared `Timeline`, the outer Window and resolved Instants; it does not
interpret Script semantics itself and has no Studio dependency.

The bundled preview icons come from [Tabler Icons](https://tabler.io/icons), distributed under the
MIT license and retrieved through the Iconify API. Their SVG files are the design sources and are
explicitly rasterized to same-size transparent PNGs before video composition. They deliberately share
one viewBox, stroke width, line-cap treatment and color instead of relying on platform emoji fonts.
