# `@hypit/spatial`

Pure two-dimensional video geometry. The package owns the final raster viewport, resolved
picture-plane geometry, source extents and affine mappings. It owns no layer tree, media, Paint,
motion, Timeline, detector, Provider or renderer policy.

## The spatial values

- `Canvas` is the final raster viewport. A `<space:Canvas>` publishes `.canvas` for raster consumers
  and `.bounds` for ordinary geometry consumers. Its runtime value contains only width and height;
  the `@1` coordinate convention is a protocol rule rather than four repeated constants.
- `SpatialPoint`, `SpatialFrame` and `SpatialPath` are plain resolved values in the program picture
  plane: top-left origin, x right, y down, square pixels. They carry no Canvas id, parent pointer or
  construction history.
- `IntrinsicExtent` is the natural width and height of a source or local picture plane.
- `ContentFit` is an authored mapping policy.
- `SpatialMap2D` is an affine map from a local plane into the program picture plane.

Canvas is deliberately not a container. Visual components own clipping, Paint, draw order and
motion. A Frame may extend outside the Canvas and may be reused anywhere its numbers mean the same
thing.

```svml
<space:Canvas id="vertical" width="1080" height="1920"/>
<space:Frame id="safe" within={vertical.bounds}
  left="6%" top="5%" right="94%" bottom="92%"/>
<space:AnchoredFrame id="portrait" within={safe}
  x="100%" y="100%" width="320px" height="320px" anchor="bottom-right"/>
```

`Frame`, `AnchoredFrame` and `AspectFrame` are three constructors for the same runtime
`SpatialFrame`. Other layout packages can publish that same Type without modifying this package.

An author or project component that already knows an affine relation can publish it directly:

```svml
<space:Map id="turned" xx="0" xy="-0.5" yx="0.5" yy="0" tx="920" ty="180"/>
```

This is the open value below fitting conveniences, not a scene node. It carries no source, Frame,
Canvas identity, clipping policy or time.

## Content fitting resolves a mapping

`resolveContentFit(frame, extent, fit)` returns a `SpatialMap2D`. It does not invent a second
`FittedContent` model. Consumers may apply the map to source-local Points and Paths, and may derive
the mapped source bounds when they need a rectangular optimization or diagnostic. That bounding
rectangle is not the mapping and cannot replace it after rotation, skew or reflection.

`ContentFit.sizing` selects the scale before alignment:

| Sizing | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `contain` | Preserve aspect and fit both dimensions inside the destination |
| `cover` | Preserve aspect and cover both destination dimensions |
| `fit-width` / `fit-height` | Preserve aspect and match the named dimension |
| `native` | Keep the source's pixel dimensions |
| `scale-down` | Use `contain` while limiting scale to at most 1 |
| `stretch` | Match destination width and height independently |

`framePoint` selects a normalized point in the destination and `contentPoint` selects the source
point placed there. `offsetPx` adds an explicit displacement. `bounded` constrains the translation
to the available placement range; `free` preserves the authored translation. Clipping is still the
visual consumer's decision.

The Recipe decoder exposes `fit`, `frame-x`, `frame-y`, `content-x`, `content-y`, `fit-offset-x`,
`fit-offset-y` and `fit-constraint`. Visual Track uses it, and project components may use the same
pure functions.

## Evidence over time is a peer package

Frame-indexed observations do not belong to static geometry. `@hypit/region-evidence` relates prepared
regions to a Timeline and resolves them into picture-plane Frames. Detection, identity association,
interpolation and source-to-picture projection remain explicit preparation or project-package work.
This keeps Spatial reusable and prevents a central scene or evidence registry.
