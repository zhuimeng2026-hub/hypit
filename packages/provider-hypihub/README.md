# `@hypit/provider-hypihub`

Thin Hypit Runtime Provider for a HypiHub deployment. It is an optional default gateway for
paid generation and WhisperX alignment requests. Select it for a chosen HypiHub account, with OAuth
or an API key in the configured Credential Store; other Providers remain ordinary Profile choices.

The implementation uses only the public `@hypit/hypit/*` Provider APIs. Its one cross-package
contract is an explicit peer on `@hypit/whisperx`, whose capability identity, request validation and
wire-response interpretation it implements remotely. Compatible published releases use an ordinary
SemVer range; the consuming project's npm/pnpm lockfile fixes the installed pair. Hypit performs no
Provider download, version resolution or Build-time upgrade. The Provider reads its own package
version for its User-Agent and does not inherit the Hypit Distribution version.

The official Distribution currently obtains this Provider as a default npm dependency because its
starter Runtime Profile selects HypiHub. The Profile selection and the npm dependency are separate:
another Distribution may omit it, and a project may install a compatible version explicitly.

`doctor` is read-only. If a stored OAuth access token needs refresh, it reports that account access
and refresh validity remain unchecked; it does not rotate credentials or conclude that their Store
is read-only. Authorized execution and pricing reads retain the normal refresh-and-persist path.
An actual refresh rejection calls for reconnecting the selected account.

Its mapping table declares the image/video/speech model capabilities it implements, including image edits and
image-to-video first-frame inputs, submits jobs, polls them, downloads the first-class assets and
admits them into the current Build's working byte area. Image references use HypiHub's documented
`reference_images` object shape (`[{ "url": "…" }]`); video references use the public
`reference_image_urls`, `reference_videos`, and `reference_audios` fields. A single reference video
remains in `reference_videos`; `ref_video_url` is reserved for a model's source-video port. First/last-frame images use `first_frame` and `last_frame`.

Seedance 2.5 (`@hypit/seedance` model `2.5`) maps to `seedance-2.5` and supports
`480p`, `720p` and `1080p`. The Provider passes the authored `resolution` to `POST /v1/videos`;
omitting it in the Seedance Surface defaults to `720p`.

`@hypit/pixverse` models `pixverse-v6` and `pixverse-c1` map to `pixverse/v6` and `pixverse/c1` on
`POST /v1/videos`. The model's own `quality` band travels as `resolution` and its duration as
`seconds`; frames use `first_frame` and `last_frame`, image references use `reference_image_urls`,
and V6's video references use `reference_videos`. A reference-video request carries no `seconds`.
This body has no field for V6's `seed` or `multi-clip`, so a request that states either is refused
by name before any reference is uploaded.

The current HypiHub GPT Image 2 route has these service-specific limits:

| Resolution | Ratios unavailable at this Endpoint | `background` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `1K` | none | optional |
| `2K` | `5:4`, `4:5`, `3:1`, `1:3`, `9:21` | omit |
| `4K` | `3:1`, `1:3`, `9:21` | omit |

HypiHub owns this support check independently: it leaves the GPT Image model package unchanged. When the service surface changes, this Provider can change without changing
the model or another Provider.

Model identity and input mode are separate. The mapping uses HypiHub's canonical model names:
`gpt-image-2`, `seedream-5-lite`, `minimax-h3`, `grok-imagine-video`, `pixverse/v6`,
`pixverse/c1` and the individual Seedance names.
An image request without references uses `/images/generations`; image edits use `/images/edits`
with the same model name. Video requests use `/videos`, preserving reference images, reference
videos and first/last frames in their distinct fields. Old operation-specific names are not needed
to express these modes; compatibility with previously released clients belongs to the service.

Seedream 5 Lite remains Lite across input modes, and Grok 1.5 Preview remains Preview.
A deployment's current catalogue may offer
newer models or omit one implemented here. Availability and unsupported-input errors retain their
service explanation; they do not imply expired credentials or authorize substituting another model.

Before resolving or uploading references, the Provider prepares the exact model and operation from
the authored ports and its mapping, then queries that model's authenticated directory entry. Image
editing is determined from the mapped media inputs, without manufacturing placeholder URLs or
uploading to discover the request mode. The same preparation serves images, videos and speech.
The request is then translated with real reference URLs and submitted to the selected operation.
These are internal Provider functions; Author Sources, CLI commands and Runtime scheduling are unchanged.

Progress identifies the directory query, request preparation and submission. A directory failure
retains the model, operation and service evidence, and states that this invocation uploaded no
references and submitted no generation. A missing or malformed operation list leaves support unknown;
an explicit list without the requested operation reports the actual list. No alternative model,
operation or account is attempted. Directory support alone does not establish balance, every input
combination or eventual generation success. Preparation failure also reports that generation was not
submitted; an interrupted submission retains its actual evidence without claiming no remote work exists.

The Provider interprets HypiHub's [HTTP errors](https://hypit.ai/api-reference/errors/) and
[job errors](https://hypit.ai/api-reference/jobs/) locally. Failures retain the service code,
HTTP method/route/status, requested model and `X-Request-Id` when available, plus the public reason.
`Retry-After` remains evidence and does not start another generation attempt. Job failures retain
`error_code`, `error` and their receipt even when the create response is already terminal.
Known error messages are not cut to a fixed prefix; only an unstructured non-JSON response uses
a marked excerpt. Unrelated response fields and signed asset URLs are not diagnostic content.
Runtime and Result retain ordinary failure codes/messages without interpreting HypiHub fields.
Immediate Endpoint exceptions keep the same evidence in their message. A `401` alone does not
choose OAuth over API-key configuration or establish that another login will fix the account.

For moving portraits, [Volcengine Matting](../volcengine-matting/README.md) maps
`@hypit/volcengine-matting@1#matte-portrait-video` to `POST /v1/videos` with
`model: "matte-portrait-video"`, `ref_video_url` and `format` (`WEBM` by default, or `MOV`).
Both formats carry transparency. The source video uses the same upload transport as other video
references; the returned job uses the same polling and asset collection lifecycle. The selected
account's `/v1/models` establishes availability. The processed video enters ordinary Normalize,
then a Visual Clip or another ordinary media consumer; add semantic alignment separately when a
Script relationship needs positions inside that performance.

Runtime Profile example:

```json
{
  "format": "hypit.runtime-local@1",
  "dataRoot": ".hypit/runtimes/local",
  "credentials": {
    "platform": {
      "use": "@hypit/credential-store-local"
    }
  },
  "endpoints": {
    "hypihub.default": {
      "use": "@hypit/provider-hypihub",
      "pool": "hypihub.default",
      "config": {
        "baseUrl": "https://hypit.ai",
        "apiKey": { "store": "platform", "key": "hypihub.oauth" },
        "defaultConcurrency": 3,
        "pollIntervalMs": 10000
      }
    }
  },
  "bindings": {}
}
```

Remote transcription exposes the same `@hypit/whisperx` alignment capability implemented by the local
WhisperX Provider. The Runtime Profile selects which Endpoint serves it. Run
`hypit auth login hypihub.default --runtime hypit.runtime.json` to sign in with HypiHub OAuth when
choosing HypiHub. A Profile may set `baseUrl`
to the selected deployment's origin or an existing `/v1`/`/v1beta` base. The Runtime Provider
normalizes it to `/v1`; missing or insufficient user
credentials should be resolved at [hypit.ai](https://hypit.ai). Referenced image, audio and video
Resources are uploaded through a session from `POST /v1/files/uploads`, followed by the private
regional multipart instructions or `api_multipart` file POST selected by HypiHub. The latter sends
one multipart/form-data file to the selected service's `/v1/files`, preserving reference purpose
and person classification; an uncertain file POST is not repeated automatically.
For direct multipart uploads, the Provider follows the server-selected part
size and part concurrency, retries a failed part with a fresh signed URL, completes or cancels that
one upload, and then passes the returned HTTPS URL to generation or transcription. Signing requests
contain at most the service's 128-part limit; all batches belong to the same upload. One
Resource identity with the same declared person-reference classification is uploaded once within one Runtime operation. Hypit keeps no upload catalog or
cross-Build cache. Seedance visual references require boolean `personReference` in their media fields;
the mapping declares it as a resource-transport field and the upload session receives
`is_person_reference`, preserving true and false. It stays out of the generation body.
This covers reference images, reference videos, and first/last frames for every declared Seedance
variant. Seedance rejects omission before upload; no automatic face detection is requested.
HypiHub stores the authored classification and prepares the applicable upstream person reference;
this Provider does not detect faces or select an upstream private-avatar group.

Embedded callers may replace transport with `publicAssetUrl(artifact, resources, fields)`. That
callback receives the declared resource fields and must preserve any required service preparation,
such as uploading a marked person reference through HypiHub before returning its URL.

OAuth login stores the access token, refresh token and expiry as one opaque credential value. The
browser callback only confirms that authorization returned to the CLI; the CLI reports success after
the bounded token exchange and Credential Store write complete. `oauthRequestTimeoutMs` controls that
exchange and defaults to 30 seconds, independently of the longer inference request timeout. The
Provider refreshes that value shortly before expiry or after an unauthorised response when the
selected Store is writable. Its Endpoint receives only the credential slot it declared and a narrow
operation for replacing that same slot; it cannot enumerate the Store, choose another key or read
another Endpoint's credentials. A raw credential remains an ordinary static API key.

Refresh uses `oauthRequestTimeoutMs` during generation, transcription, uploads and pricing too.
It completes before the subsequent API request starts its own deadline. A stalled refresh reports
an OAuth refresh timeout without starting that API request.

The service currently requires whole-file and per-part SHA-256 values as fields of its signed upload
protocol. They exist only while transferring bytes; Hypit never uses them as Resource identity,
Result metadata, lookup keys or reuse evidence. Signed URLs and their query credentials are removed
from surfaced upload errors.

The default remote alignment model is `victor-upmeet/whisperx`; `transcriptionModel` may select another
HypiHub model that exposes the `transcriptions` route. When transcription response headers include
`X-Request-Id`, the Provider records it in the existing execution diagnostics before reading the body.
A matching same-service `Location` is retained as the authenticated result lookup URL, including on
an HTTP failure or interrupted response body. This is a receipt for investigation, not automatic
resubmission or Build restoration. No receipt can be recorded if no response headers arrive.

`hypit doctor` reads the authenticated model
catalog to verify configured capabilities; ordinary preflight never makes that request. The package
declares HypiHub's public pricing page, `https://hypit.ai/commercial/pricing/`, as its price source.
For each selected Need, `readPricing` resolves the corresponding HypiHub model and returns the service's
authenticated `GET /v1/pricing?model=<model>` response unchanged together with that URL. It covers
generation, alignment, Voice Design and Voice Clone through the same mechanism. The document's
per-operation prices are retained alongside its default price, including when references are still
pending. A model's default price is not a quote for every input mode. The Provider does not maintain
a second list of billing formulas or calculate a request total.

The Provider declares its implemented speech capabilities alongside image, video and alignment.
Voice Design produces an accepted voice-reference Resource, and Voice Clone uses that
reference to produce independent speech. All of them use `POST /v1/audio/speech`:

| Package | Capability | HypiHub model | Request fields |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `@hypit/mimo-speech` | `mimo-v2.5-tts-voicedesign` | `mimo-v2.5-tts-voicedesign` | `input`, `voice_description` |
| `@hypit/mimo-speech` | `mimo-v2.5-tts-voiceclone` | `mimo-v2.5-tts-voiceclone` | `input`, `reference_audio`, optional `prompt` |
| `@hypit/fishaudio-speech` | `voice-design-1` | `fishaudio/voice-design-1` | `input`, `voice_description` |
| `@hypit/fishaudio-speech` | `voice-clone` | `fishaudio/voice-clone` | `input`, `reference_audio`, constant `voice_description` title |
| `@hypit/elevenlabs-speech` | `eleven_ttv_v3` | `eleven_ttv_v3` | `input`, `voice_description` |

Each returned preview becomes one member of the audio set. These Model packages do not expose preset
voices. When another selected Endpoint offers the same capability (such as local WhisperX or a project-owned speech
Provider), the Runtime Profile's `bindings` say which Endpoint serves it.

Execution policy remains local to this Provider:

| Profile field | Default | What it controls |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `requestTimeoutMs` | 300 seconds | ordinary Provider HTTP requests |
| `oauthRequestTimeoutMs` | 30 seconds | OAuth token exchange and refresh |
| `pricingRequestTimeoutMs` | 30 seconds | authenticated pricing requests |
| `operationTimeoutMs` | 20 minutes | how long this Provider observes one asynchronous operation; expiry does not cancel the remote job |
| `uploadConcurrency` | 8 | whole file sessions per origin/credential within this process |
| `uploadPartTimeoutMs` | 5 minutes | one upload part |
| `uploadPartAttempts` | 3 | attempts for one upload part |
| `downloadAttempts` | 3 | attempts to collect one result |

`defaultConcurrency` controls the total shared capacity of this Profile's HypiHub pool. Optional `capabilityConcurrency`
sets narrower group limits, for example `{ "seedance-2-mini": 2, "transcription": 1 }`.
Image/video/speech groups use the exact capability name; WhisperX uses `transcription`. These limits
coordinate this Runtime's requests; HypiHub remains
responsible for service-wide account limits. Immediate speech/transcription slots cover the
active HTTP invocation, while asynchronous image/video slots cover remote work until completion or local execution failure.

For asynchronous image/video jobs, `actionLimits` configures the common `submit`, `poll` and `collect`
admission budgets. Each accepts `concurrency` and `rate: { limit, periodMs }`, shared by the pool.
These limits count lifecycle actions; Provider-specific upload parts and HTTP requests remain inside
those actions. Synchronous speech and transcription retain their ordinary request capacity.

A submission or collection error ends the local attempt. During polling, transport failures and HTTP
429/5xx preserve the same job handle and schedule another read; a standard `Retry-After` is honored,
but the wake time never passes the original `operationTimeoutMs` deadline. Credential, response and
other non-retryable errors still end the attempt. Known job IDs and credential references remain
available in Result receipts; a timeout with no ID is recorded as such. A job can
be inspected at `/jobs/<id>` and its generated assets at `/jobs/<id>/assets` on the selected API base.
The next production attempt uses a new Run and Build. Runtime bindings never switch from a user's
own Provider to HypiHub after a key, quota or transport failure.

`uploadConcurrency` bounds whole files inside the Provider transport. Uploader instances in the same
process share the limit for the same service origin and current credential; the smallest outstanding
limit applies. Token refresh can change that grouping. Separate processes are not coordinated by this
local limit. It is a positive safe integer; HypiHub still enforces its own account quota. Part
concurrency is separately negotiated by HypiHub for each file. These are transport limits inside a
Runtime action, not additional Build admission limits.

Signing, completing and cancelling a known upload session may retry temporary transport failures
within at most four attempts and the smaller of `requestTimeoutMs` or 120 seconds. A new upload
session is retried only after an explicit temporary 429 rejection; an unknown creation result ends
the attempt. Daily and storage quota errors fail immediately. Active part workers finish before the
session is cancelled. An unconfirmed cancellation logs its upload ID without exposing signed URLs.
OAuth refresh retries the rejected control request on the same session. None of this resumes a
failed Build or changes the selected Provider.
