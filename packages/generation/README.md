# `@hypit/hypit/generation`

Provider-neutral generated-media contracts shared by exact image, video and audio model packages.

External Model and Provider packages import this public subpath from the `@hypit/hypit` Distribution.
It gives both sides the same request and result vocabulary without a dependency between their
implementations. `sealGenerationPortTable` describes a model's inputs; `GenerationWireMapping` and
`compileWireRequest` can translate those inputs to one Provider's documented wire fields.
`selectWireModelForRequest` applies the same route selection without resolving media bytes. During
planning, a Provider may add the model-port names already attached as future graph inputs; the
selector does not inspect graph structure or interpret media roles.
Route selection here applies declared input-mode mappings for the already chosen exact capability;
it does not search for an alternative model, service or account.

`compileWireRequest` awaits its media URL resolver, so compilation can have external effects when
that resolver uploads files. Use `selectWireModelForRequest` for request identity and known-port
checks before those effects; pricing and execution can share the same mapping. A Provider can also
describe its API operation from the authored ports. Service-specific support queries belong to that
Provider and only use operations its API actually exposes. The generic helper neither queries a
catalogue nor switches to another route after a failure. Actual URL resolution belongs to request
execution, not to discovering a model name or making a planning placeholder.

The package owns `GenerationRequest`, `GeneratedAudioSet`, `GeneratedImageSet` and `GeneratedVideoSet` identities,
schemas, validators and graph facets. Generated sets are atomic Products: a Provider persists the
returned bytes in an ResourceStore and returns typed Blob references rather than transient URLs.

This package does not choose a model, Provider, credential, queue or retry policy. Model packages
declare exact request Capabilities; selected Provider packages create Endpoint instances that implement those
Capabilities in a selected Runtime Profile.

## Exact Model authoring

`@hypit/hypit/generation/model` is the author-model subpath for defining an exact generated-media
Model without repeating the nominal Type → Producer → Need → Graph Fragment shell. It belongs to
Generation because it derives request Types, validation, facets and author bindings directly from
one `GenerationPortTable`; it is not a second Model registry or a generic kit.

```ts
import { defineExactModelModule } from "@hypit/hypit/generation/model";
import { sealGenerationPortTable } from "@hypit/hypit/generation";
```

The Model still owns its exact name, accepted ports, constraints and validation. The selected
Provider separately owns supported wire mappings and execution. The helper performs no Provider
selection, fallback, credential lookup or Runtime routing.

## Reference fields in resource transport

A service may consume per-media metadata while preparing a URL rather than in its generation JSON.
Media wire mappings (`url`, `urlArray`, `itemObject`) may declare `resourceFields: ["fieldName"]`.
`compileWireRequest` supplies those present item fields as the second argument to its URL resolver;
`itemObject.fieldKeys` separately maps fields into the generation body. Port coverage checks both
paths against the declared media fields. False, zero and empty strings remain values; omitted fields
remain absent. The resolver implements the service protocol; this package knows no particular
service or classification. Providers using custom transports carry those fields through that boundary.

A Model item field being optional means authors may omit it. If a request supplies that field,
`mappingSupportsRequest` and final wire compilation require the mapping to carry it through
`fieldKeys` or `resourceFields`, including an explicit `false`. A service may support requests
without a particular optional field and refuse requests that supply it; no field is silently dropped.
Final compilation checks the whole request before resolving or uploading any reference.
