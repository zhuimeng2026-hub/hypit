# `@hypit/volcengine-matting`

Remove the background of a moving portrait when the composition needs the person's silhouette
over another picture. The source video determines the performance, duration and dimensions.

```svml
<import as="matte" from="@hypit/volcengine-matting@1"/>
<matte:Portrait id="cutout" source={performance.video}/>
```

`source` is a video Blob from a file declaration, generation or another media operation.
`cutout.video` is the processed video Blob. `format="WEBM"` is the default; `format="MOV"`
selects a transparent QuickTime output. This interface exposes the model's two transparent
formats. The service's flat-background MP4 option is a different output treatment.

## Prepare the processed clip for its role

```svml
<import as="mediaop" from="@hypit/media-operations@1"/>
<import as="whisperx" from="@hypit/whisperx@1"/>
<import as="semantic" from="@hypit/narrative-temporal@1"/>
<import as="media" from="@hypit/media@1"/>

<time:Clock id="clock" frame-rate="30"/>
<mediaop:Normalize id="cutout-media" source={cutout.video} clock={clock}
  video="primary-moving" audio="default" span-authority="video"/>
<whisperx:Alignment id="opening-alignment" narrative={story}
  segment={story.segment.opening} media={cutout-media.media}
  domain={cutout-media.domain} language="en"/>
<time:Timeline id="speech" clock={clock} end="opening.end">
  <time:Window id="opening" from="start" for={cutout-media.extent}/>
</time:Timeline>
<semantic:Projection id="story-time" narrative={story} timeline={speech.timeline}>
  <semantic:Map alignment={opening-alignment.alignment}
    domain={cutout-media.domain} window={speech.opening}/>
</semantic:Projection>
```

This excerpt assumes the performance and Script exist. Normalize keeps the transparent picture and
prepares the selected embedded audio. WhisperX associates the Script Segment with the media-local
domain; Timeline uses its Extent while semantic projection consumes the equal-length domain/Window
relation and then discards it. Use `cutout-media.media` with `during={speech.opening}` in independent
Visual and Audio Clips. Screen position and stack order remain visual choices.

For independently timed footage, normalize `cutout.video` with `audio="none"` when its sound is
unwanted, then use `cutout-media.media` in a [Visual Clip](../visual-track/README.md). No semantic
alignment is needed for that overlay. Existing transparency can enter Normalize directly.

For example, this alternative uses the existing program's Timeline and an authored Selection:

```svml
<import as="visual" from="@hypit/visual-track@1"/>
<mediaop:Normalize id="overlay-media" source={cutout.video} clock={clock}
  video="primary-moving" audio="none" span-authority="video"/>
<visual:Track id="overlay" timeline={speech.timeline}>
  <visual:Clip media={overlay-media.media} during={example}
    frame={overlay-frame} z="30" fit="contain" treatment={look.visual.overlay}/>
</visual:Track>
```

The Frame, treatment Recipe and Selection belong to the composition. Add `overlay.visual` to Film;
the Clip's direct `z` sets its stacking order. The performance underneath continues to supply
semantic time.

The same processed clip can serve either role; matting does not choose its Track or timeline.
The local media Provider's Transform currently emits opaque MP4. When a clip also needs trimming
or retiming, apply that operation before matting, then normalize the cutout for its intended role.

Review motion, hair, hands, translucent edges and the selected speech against the intended
background. Reuse `cutout.video` or the prepared Output through the Run when changing placement,
captions or graphics.

## Model and Provider

The capability is `@hypit/volcengine-matting@1#matte-portrait-video`, returning a GeneratedVideoSet.
The Portrait Surface publishes its first video as `.video`. Its model ports are `source`
(one video) and optional `format` (`WEBM` or `MOV`). It takes no generation prompt or duration.

[HypiHub Provider](../provider-hypihub/README.md) maps it to `POST /v1/videos` with
`model: "matte-portrait-video"`, `ref_video_url` and `format`. Account availability and credentials
belong to the selected Runtime Endpoint. Submission, job polling, collection and Result storage
use that Provider's existing video operation.

To select this route explicitly in a Runtime Profile, bind the capability to an existing
HypiHub Endpoint:

```json
{
  "bindings": {
    "@hypit/volcengine-matting@1#matte-portrait-video": "hypihub.default"
  }
}
```

Here `hypihub.default` is the Endpoint ID from that profile. The Model describes the operation;
the Provider translates it to the service; the Endpoint supplies the account and execution settings.
No source duration or resolution needs to be copied into the Source or Runtime Profile.

The input and output formats follow [Volcengine's portrait-matting reference](https://github.com/volcengine/mediakit-cli/blob/main/skills/byted-mediakit-video/reference/matte-portrait-video.md).
