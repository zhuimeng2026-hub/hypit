# `@hypit/media-local`

Trusted local ffprobe/ffmpeg owner. It exposes the same concrete local-media behavior through three
orthogonal ports:

- a Provider port implements `@hypit/media-operations` Needs against a Build's ResourceStore;
- a file port inspects or creates files explicitly named by an authoring tool;
- `@hypit/media-local/cli` presents that file port as `hypit media`.

The Provider is Runtime configuration and is never imported by author `.svml`. The file and CLI ports
do not manufacture a Graph, Build, Result or Runtime state.

This Provider owns its FFmpeg commands, media inspection, animated-WebP handling and audio-program
execution. They are implementation details of this machine executor, not a shared domain package or
a root `@hypit/hypit` facade. Another Provider implements the same Needs against the public operation
contracts rather than importing this Provider's process code.

The local process runner is shared by the Provider and file ports, so bounds, shell avoidance and
failure reporting do not fork into two executors. Domain contracts remain in `@hypit/media-operations`;
paths, subprocesses and ffprobe output remain here.

## File authoring and inspection

```bash
hypit media probe reference.mp4
hypit media cut reference.mp4 --start 12 --end 19.5 --to assets/hook.mp4
hypit media frames reference.mp4 --at 12.4,13.1 --to notes/hook-frames
hypit media tile reference.mp4 --start 12 --end 19.5 --to notes/hook-grid.jpg
hypit media tiles reference.mp4 --ranges notes/ranges.json --to notes/grids
hypit media boundaries reference.mp4
```

Network acquisition is not a media-execution operation. `@hypit/yt-dlp/cli` owns
`hypit download`; the resulting file becomes an ordinary input to these commands.

Frame extraction, native-PTS sequences and labelled grids are evidence about a source media clock.
They therefore live beside the decoder that establishes that clock. `HtmlProgram` frames remain an
`html-program` concern, and capturing Studio's current `HtmlProgram` remains a Studio concern; the word
“frame” does not create a central package.

`tile` and `tiles` use the same grid-layout helper exported for Studio snapshot presentation. Reusing
that pure layout does not transfer frame acquisition or Runtime authority. Transcript-aware ranges
consume `hypit.transcript@1`; parsing and phrase matching are owned by `@hypit/speech-evidence`, while
this package only joins those ranges to file decoding.

```ts
import { createLocalMediaProvider } from "@hypit/media-local";

const media = createLocalMediaProvider({ instance: "media.local", defaultConcurrency: 1 });
```

An embedding adds `media` to a complete explicit Runtime assembly and grants `process:media`; the
declarative form selects this package through the Runtime Profile.

The Endpoint:

- bounds subprocess duration and ffprobe JSON size;
- invokes binaries without a shell;
- enumerates all streams and records ffprobe implementation identity;
- maps explicit stream indexes into ffmpeg instead of relying on `0:v:0` / `0:a:0` guesses;
- uses the selected authority stream's presentation interval;
- preserves source A/V offset through deterministic trim, delay, pad and crop operations;
- emits a silent CFR visual and, when selected, an exact-length 48 kHz stereo PCM WAV;
- transforms synchronized A/V, extracts generic reference audio and extracts exact source frames;
- encodes authored image frames as ordinary finite video-only MP4 with explicit BT.709 conversion and
  colour metadata before normalization;
- renders an explicit `AudioProgramPlan` into one exact-length 48 kHz stereo PCM `TimelineAudio`;
- muxes exactly one verified silent visual stream and one verified program-audio stream into MP4;
- distinguishes AAC coding-frame padding from the authoritative packet presentation span.

Normalize preserves alpha: transparent input becomes VP9 / `yuva420p` WebM, while opaque input
uses H.264 / `yuv420p` MP4. The input pixel format and WebM alpha metadata determine the choice.
Animated WebP is also normalized through an alpha-capable output. Transparent VP8/VP9 input uses libvpx
decoders so FFmpeg retains the alpha sidecar, including during PNG frame extraction.
Transparent normalization requires an FFmpeg build with the `libvpx-vp9` encoder; the normal
process error reports a missing codec if a custom deployment does not provide it.
The lossless alpha encoding uses libvpx row threading and its realtime effort profile. Those options
change encoder work, not the decoded frames or the public SynchronizedMedia value; no hidden media
cache or content identity is introduced.
These are this FFmpeg implementation's intermediate encodings; Source and Track inputs continue
to use ordinary SynchronizedMedia. Transform currently emits opaque MP4, so perform trim/retime
before matting when the resulting clip needs transparency.

The result is ordinary SynchronizedMedia. Timeline construction consumes only its local domain;
Visual Clip or a Visual Clip consumes its transparent picture according to the authored
relationship. The local HTML Provider extracts alpha-preserving PNGs and composites them against the authored
Canvas and lower visual layers before encoding the final MP4.

The Runtime Adapter declares the selected `ffmpeg`/`ffprobe` pair as an external, non-daemon Program.
Its probe checks that the selected executables start in the media execution environment. It does not
guarantee every codec or filter for every task; an unsupported operation reports FFmpeg’s actual error. Custom paths
remain valid; the package neither pins a semantic Capability to one FFmpeg version nor mutates a
system package manager.

The reusable display-materialization capabilities—inspection, normalization, transform, extraction,
StillVideo—also opt into transient authoring execution. Speech-evidence projection,
timeline-audio rendering and final muxing remain Build-only. This is declared per capability; the
Runtime and Studio contain no media capability allowlist.

Video-backed normalization is video-authoritative so an AAC packet tail cannot extend the program
past its final picture. Audio-only normalization is audio-authoritative. Other implementations of these capabilities must preserve the same public values and timing laws;
a different execution topology leaves author meaning unchanged.
