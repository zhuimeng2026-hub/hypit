# `@hypit/video`

Assembly for the official Hypit video application. This package chooses the Markup author language,
the filesystem Workspace, Source-package discovery and the starter Runtime Profile. It also owns the
`hypit vocabulary` view because that view describes the author packages selected by this video
Distribution.

It is deliberately **not** a general video utility package. Browser capture, local media inspection,
speech measurement, WhisperX transcription and Studio snapshots are owned by their respective
packages and contribute their own CLI roots:

| Command | Owner |
| --- | --- |
| `capture` | `@hypit/browser-capture/cli` |
| `media` | `@hypit/media-local/cli` |
| `measure` | `@hypit/speech-estimate/cli` |
| `transcribe` | `@hypit/whisperx/cli` |
| `studio`, `snapshot` | `@hypit/studio/cli` |
| `vocabulary` | `@hypit/video/cli` |

The root executable is the composition root. Its explicit `hypit.cli.use` list installs these command
contributions under one `hypit` command; `@hypit/video/cli` does not forward or rediscover them.
Installing or importing an arbitrary Source package never grants it CLI or process authority.

## Application assembly

`createVideoDistribution()` supplies the generic CLI Host with video-product choices:

- `createVideoCompiler()` assembles the selected Author Frontends, Markup Surfaces, Modules and
  validators for one invocation;
- `createVideoWorkspace()` resolves Source and asset imports from the project and selected
  Distribution without treating arbitrary package directories as projects;
- `discoverVideoSourcePackages()` discovers the closure named by explicit Run and Author imports;
- the starter Runtime Profile selects ordinary independently distributed Providers and Credential
  Stores by package name;
- Local Runtime and Result Repository adapters remain Host concerns and do not enter Author values.

These are replaceable product-assembly decisions, not new Core concepts. A different application may
reuse the generic compiler and CLI contracts with another Frontend or Workspace.

## Vocabulary

```bash
hypit vocabulary
hypit vocabulary @hypit/media-operations --tag StillVideo
hypit vocabulary --visual text
```

The command reports installed Author-package manifests and their declared Surfaces. It does not keep
a registry, scan the network, install packages or make creative choices. Package managers and the
project lockfile own physical package versions; Source imports own which logical Modules participate
in a compilation.

## Boundary

The package may depend on compiler, loader, workspace and product assembly APIs. It must not become a
place to put functionality merely because that functionality is useful while making a video. A
capability belongs with the behavior and authority it implements; its optional CLI is only another
port of that owner.
